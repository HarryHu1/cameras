# Gumstix Cameras

At Gumstix we provide many cameras supported by our various devices.  This includes a variety of parallel-interface cameras and a selection of MIPI CSI-2 camera modules, using high-speed LVDS (low-voltage differential signal) connections.

## Our Cameras:

* Caspa and Caspa FS (Full Spectrum)
* Tiny Caspa
* Caspa HD
* Caspa 4K
* Kai-Lap-Tek KLT-OV5640

##  This Repository
In this GitHub repository, you will find scripts, applications, board support and setup guides for these camera modules as they become available.

**Note: As of Feb. 2019, only the OV5640 cameras are supported for dragonboard-410c on rocko builds. Additional support for other cameras and boards may be provided in the future.**
